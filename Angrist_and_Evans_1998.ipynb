    "Angrist and Evans (1998) study the causal mechanisms between fertility and the work effort of both men and women. The authors begin by explaining the theoretical and practical reasons of studying the relationship between fertility and labor supply. First, there has been development of economic models that link the family and the labor market. Second, the relationship between fertility and labor supply could explain the increase of women's participation in the labor market in the post-war period, where having fewer children could have increased the female labor-force share. Meanwhile, other studies have linked fertility with female withdraws from the labor market and lower wages compared to men.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mayority of empirical studies related to childbearing and labor supply find a negative correlation between family size (i.e., fertility) and female labor force. However, in his assesment of Economics of the Family, Robert J. Willis argues that there has not been well-measured exogenous variables that allow to separate cause and effect relationships from correlations among variables such as delay of marriage, decline of childbearing, increase in divorces, and increase in female labor force participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this vein, the authors argue that the problems concerning the causal association between family size and labor supply arises from the theoretical argument that both factors are jointly determinated. For example, some labor-supply econometric models often use child-status variables as regressors on hours of work. On the other hand, economic demographers usually measure the effect of wages on fertility. According to the authors, \"*since fertility variables cannot be both dependent and exogenous at the same time, it seems unlikely that either sort of regression has a causal interpretation*\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Angrist and Evans (1998) contribute by using an **instrumental variable strategy (IV)** based on the sex-mix of children in families with two or more kids. This captures parental preferences for mixed-sex siblings, where parents of same-sex children are much more likely to have an additional child.\n",

    "## A. Data & Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Angrist and Evans (1998) use two extracts from the Census Public Use Micro Samples(PUMS) that correspond to the year 1980 and 1990 respectively. The Census contains information on labor supply, the sex of mother's first two children, and an indicator of multiple births.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is no retrospective fertility information in the PUMS data sets other than the total number of children ever born. That means, the census does not track children across households. The authors thus matched children to mothers within households accordingly to the following strategy: they attached people in a household labeled as *child* to a female householder or the spouse of a male householder. They deleted any mother for whom the number of children in the household did not match the total amount of children ever born. Also, in households with multiple families, relationship codes and subfamily identifiers were used to pair children with mothers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample is then limited to mothers aged 21-35 whose oldest child was less than 18 years old at the time of the Census. There are two main reasons to restrict the data in such fashion. First, few women younger than age 21 have two children, thus taking into account younger women will decrease the number of observations for the instrumental variable *more than two children* . Second, a child over 18 is very likely to have moved to a different household. It is very unlikely that a woman aged 35 years old at the time of the census has a child 18 year old or more. Thus, restricting the sample to women aged 35 or less assures that the two children are still living in the household and therefore, still be financially dependent from their parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the empirical analysis, the authors use two samples for each year of census. The first includes all women (after restricting the sample to mothers aged 21-35) with two or more children. The second sample includes only married women for testing the main theories of household production (e.g., Gronau, 1973) and exploring the impact of children as well on father's labor supply.\n",

Just as stated in Angrist and Evans (1998), among all the women who already had a second child, 40.2 percent had a third, where the correspoding fraction for the 1990 sample is 37 percent. For both samples, around 50% of all the families with two childs have children of the same gender and above 51% of first births correspond to a boy.\n",

In the 1980 PUMS, multiple births is constructed as siblings who have the same age and quarter of birth (note: for the construction of this indicator, the age of the second and third child was used; this means, the twin birth corresponds to the mother's second birth). For the 1980 PUMS, the mean of *twins* is 0.09 for the sample of all women and 0.08 for the sample of married women. Since the variable quarter of birth is not reported for the 1990 PUMS dataset, the multiple birth variable was defined as children who have the same age."
