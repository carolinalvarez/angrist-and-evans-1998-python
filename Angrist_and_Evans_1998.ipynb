    "Angrist and Evans (1998) study the causal mechanisms between fertility and the work effort of both men and women. The authors begin by explaining the theoretical and practical reasons of studying the relationship between fertility and labor supply. First, there has been development of economic models that link the family and the labor market. Second, the relationship between fertility and labor supply could explain the increase of women's participation in the labor market in the post-war period, where having fewer children could have increased the female labor-force share. Meanwhile, other studies have linked fertility with female withdraws from the labor market and lower wages compared to men.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mayority of empirical studies related to childbearing and labor supply find a negative correlation between family size (i.e., fertility) and female labor force. However, in his assesment of Economics of the Family, Robert J. Willis argues that there has not been well-measured exogenous variables that allow to separate cause and effect relationships from correlations among variables such as delay of marriage, decline of childbearing, increase in divorces, and increase in female labor force participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this vein, the authors argue that the problems concerning the causal association between family size and labor supply arises from the theoretical argument that both factors are jointly determinated. For example, some labor-supply econometric models often use child-status variables as regressors on hours of work. On the other hand, economic demographers usually measure the effect of wages on fertility. According to the authors, \"*since fertility variables cannot be both dependent and exogenous at the same time, it seems unlikely that either sort of regression has a causal interpretation*\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Angrist and Evans (1998) contribute by using an **instrumental variable strategy (IV)** based on the sex-mix of children in families with two or more kids. This captures parental preferences for mixed-sex siblings, where parents of same-sex children are much more likely to have an additional child.\n",

This condition, if fulfilled, means the RDD can closely emulate a randomized experiment and allows researchers to identify the causal effects of treatment. \n",

    "1. The study focuses on first-year students, assuming this group of students is likely to be less familiar with the probation policy on campus. To verify their conjecture, the authors also conducted a survey in an introductory economics course which revealed that around 50 % of students were unsure of the probation cutoff at their campus. They also claim that this analysis showed no relationship between knowledge of probation cutoffs and students' grades. \n",
    "\n",

    "3. Finally, and most importantly, the implication of local randomization is testable. If nonrandom sorting were to be a problem, there should be a discontinuity in the distribution of grades at the cutoff with a disproportionate number of students scoring just above the cutoff. Additionally, all the covariates should be continuous throughout the cutoff to ensure that the group above the probation cutoff constitutes a realistic counterfactual for the treated group.\n",

To find a lower bound of the estimate, Lindo et al. (2010) assume that academic probation causes students who would have performed worse in the next term to drop out. The control group is thus made comparable by dropping the lowest-performing students (in the next term) from the sample, assuming these students would have dropped out had they been placed on probation. To calculate the upper bound estimate, the same share of students is dropped from the upper part of the grade distribution instead. \n",

For example, in the entire sample students on probation are 1.8 percentage points more likely to drop out, which is 44% of the control mean. Thus, to make the groups comparable again we presumably need to drop 44% more students from the control group than actually dropped out. \n",

    "\n",
    "As a third outcome, Lindo et al. (2010) examine the effects of academic probation on students' graduation rates. As already discussed in the previous section, the outcomes that are realized later in time are more complex to examine because of all the different choices a student has made until she or he reaches that outcome. Graduation rates are the product of a dynamic decision-making process that spans throughout the students' time at university. While the study focuses mainly on the effects of being put on probation after the first year, the decision problem described in the theoretical framework can be faced by students at different points during their academic career as students can be placed on probation each term or for multiple terms in a row. There are different ways in which academic probation could affect graduation rates. On the one hand, it could reduce the probability of graduating because probation increases the probability of dropping out and some students who fail to increase their grades are suspended. On the other hand, these students might have graduated either way and thus do not have an effect. Additionally, probation could increase graduation rates because those students who remain improve their performance. "

    "The results from Lindo et al.

These results are generally in line with the theoretical framework presented in the paper which predicts that students either drop out or improve their GPA if the cost of not improving in the next term increases. The performance standard model explains these results through students self-selecting between increasing effort and dropping out based on their abilities (which are defined as the probability of meeting the performance standard). Students who are less likely to improve their GPA should thus be more likely to drop out. Unfortunately, it is not possible to test this prediction, as Lindo et al. (2010) emphasize in the paper because the probability of meeting the performance standard is not observed for students who leave school. \n",

Overall the results are still highly significant though considering the small window of observations to which the data is reduced in this case.

Indeed, out of all students on probation (within 0.6 grade points of the cutoff), only around 37% improve their next term CGPA above the cutoff. Around 23% improve their GPA above the cutoff but not their CGPA and remain on probation. The other students dropped out or are suspended after the next term. This suggests that the effects of probation span much longer than just the subsequent term for many students, not only indirectly because they have had the experience of being placed on probation but also directly because many of them remain on probation for multiple subsequent terms. These factors underline the points made in previous sections about the complexity of the way academic probation can affect a student's academic career. After being placed on probation a student can take a multitude of different paths, many more than the theoretical framework introduced in Section 2 leads on. A more dynamic approach to estimating the effects of academic probation could likely offer more insights into how students react to this university policy."

However, from a heuristic standpoint, this bandwidth choice seems reasonable. Since the cutoff lies at a GPA of 1.5 (1.6 at Campus 3), this bandwidth includes students whose GPA falls roughly between 0.9 and 2.1 grade points, so a range of around one average grade point including the edges. A much larger bandwidth would not make sense because it would include students that are failing every class and students who are achieving passable grades and are thus not very comparable to students who pass or fall below the threshold by a small margin.\n",

    "\n",
    "Overall, the results in this notebook support the findings reported by Lindo et al. (2010) in their paper. The transparent research methods and STATA code provided by the authors allowed me to reproduce the results precisely for almost all tables and figures except for the formal bound analysis presented in Section 5.2.4. for which I could only produce similar results. In addition to the replication of the main results from Lindo et al. (2010), I discuss the identification strategy used in the paper and evaluate the robustness of the results, especially in the context of the performance standard model used in the paper. The results presented in Lindo et al. (2010) and my additional evaluation offer overall support for the performance standard model by BÃ©nabou and Tirole (2000) which predicts that students who are put on probation will be more likely to drop out of university or improve their performance if they remain in school. However, one core feature of the model, the idea that students make their choices based on their ability to meet the performance standard, could not be tested due to the fact that the subsequent performance of students who left school cannot be observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lindo et al. (2010) find large heterogeneities in the way students react to probation based on a set of covariates, however, the underlying sources of these heterogeneities are not evaluated. Further analysis of performance standards like academic probation using a larger set of information on student characteristics like personality traits, patience or socioeconomic background may thus be helpful to reveal the reasons why different students react to this negative incentive in certain ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the study focused only on the effects of academic probation in the first year and relatively short term outcomes while long term outcomes were not assessed in detail. As already discussed in the section on the effects of academic probation on graduation rates, analyzing long term outcomes is much more difficult because of the multitude of different choices a student can make before reaching a specific outcome. Being placed on probation in the first year already expands the types of paths students may follow greatly. However, students can be placed on probation, suspended or leave school each term. To analyze the long term effects of academic probation in detail, there are too many questions that the data used in this study cannot answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall the findings from Lindo et al. (2010) offer quite robust results on the effects of academic probation on low performing students. They contribute important insights into how students or individuals in general may react to negative incentives with the threat of severe real-world penalties if they fail to adjust their behavior."
