**Angrist, J.D., & Evans, W.N. (1998).** [Children and Their Parents' Labor Supply: Evidence from Exogenous Variation in Family Size](https://www.jstor.org/stable/116844?seq=1). *The American Economic Review*, 88(3). 450-477. 

Angrist and Evans (1998) focuse on the endogeneity problem arising when trying to estimate the labor-supply consequence of childbearing for women. The authors use an instrumental variable approach by exploiting the parental preferences for a mixed sibling-sex composition (i.e., children of different gender) to construct instrumental variables using same sex and twin variables. The findings of the paper is that IV estimates statistically significant and smaller than OLS, suggesting that OLS might exaggerate the effect of childbearing on labor-supply outcomes. For samples of all women and married women, the estimated coefficients of having a third child are negative, which suggest that childbearing has a negative effect on labor-supply.
